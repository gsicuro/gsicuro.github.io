All applications are processed through the King\u0026rsquo;s appplication system, accessible from the link below.\nKing\u0026rsquo;s application system\nPhD projects The mathematics of adaptive, stable and robust Artificial Intelligence Supervisor: Prof Ivan Tyukin Status: Open.\nThe studentship covers tuition fees for Home/UK students and a stipend of £19,668 per annum. The funding is available for 3.5 years. Overseas applicants will be considered but they must demonstrate the capability to fund the difference between International full-time fees (currently £28,260 per annum for 2023/2024 academic year) and Home/UK fees.\nDescription \u0026mdash; Recent years have seen explosive growth in the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Notwithstanding significant successes of the new technology, empirical evidence points to numerous examples of errors in the decisions of state-of-the-art AI systems. Current theoretical works confirm that modern design practices and classical mathematical frameworks supporting these could suffer from various fundamental shortcomings including the typicality of adversarial attacks, susceptibility to backdoors and stealth attacks, instabilities, and hallucinations. At the same time, there is a plethora of under-explored and seemingly controversial phenomena, such as learning from scarce yet high-dimensional information, which has been broadly observed experimentally in large-scale AI systems but whose complete mathematical understanding is yet to be developed. Other factors hindering the performance of current AI systems include the need to adapt to concept drifts and unforeseen changes in operational conditions. The project aims to explore and systematically assess major causes of AI errors and instabilities and develop appropriate mathematical foundations enabling the creation of stable and robust Artificial Intelligence capable of dealing with errors and concept drifts. The successful candidate will work alongside a team of early career researchers funded by the UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship (EP/V025295/2) and will benefit from the team’s established relationships with industrial partners, academic networks (Turing AI Fellows, Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Node in Verifiability EP/V026801/2), and other collaborators in academia, healthcare, defence \u0026amp; security.\nHow to apply — To state your interest, please contact directly Prof Ivan Tyukin.\nEntanglement and universality in inhomogeneous and out-of-equilibrium many body quantum systems Supervisors: Dr Paola Ruggiero and Prof Ben Doyon Status: Open.\nWe would like to bring to your attention a funded home-student PhD fellowship available in the Disordered System group at King’s College London. This is to be co-supervised by Dr Paola Ruggiero and Prof Benjamin Doyon, and to start in October 2023. The PhD project covers a broad range of topics in statistical physics and quantum many-body systems, and will be adapted to the interests of the candidate. A general description of the project can be found below.\nDescription \u0026mdash; The project lies at the intersection of several different fields: from statistical physics to quantum information, from high energy to condensed matter physics. The common denominators are the phenomenon of quantum entanglement and the out-of-equilibrium behaviour of many-body quantum systems, particularly in low dimensional quantum many body systems. While the emergence of universality is rather well established for systems which are homogeneous and are at equilibrium, the same is not true for inhomogeneous systems, both in and out of equilibrium. Those, on the other hand, are the rule rather than the exception in the context of quantum experiments. Different new tools are currently under study to investigate what remains of the aforementioned universality in such more complicated situations, and the projects aims to gain a better understanding of this topic, especially through the “lenses” of entanglement. How to apply — If you have home-fees student status, in order to express your interest, please submit first your CV and two reference letters to Paola Ruggiero.
