      <description>&lt;p&gt;The research activities of the group concentrate on the analysis and development of mathematical theories and models with which to describe the statics and dynamics of disordered (or &amp;ldquo;complex&amp;rdquo;) systems in physics, biology, financial markets, and computer science. Such systems are characterized by microscopic (usually stochastic) dynamic elements with mutual interactions without global regularity but with a significant degree of built-in competition and incompatibility, resulting in the existence of many locally stable states for the system as a whole and a highly non-ergodic &amp;ldquo;glassy&amp;rdquo; type of dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
